The key differences between it and the KDE Flagship is that it's more oriented to those of you who do not game much, and prefer to have a stable system that stays out of your way while you do your work. </p> <p>Additionally, we have avoided ricing it, e.g: no custom theme was used, following the Gnome Guidelines. All we did was use the Accent color feature to enable the Purple colors, and for consistency, we applied the Tela Circle Purple icon theme, while including just enough extensions &amp; GhosTTY terminal (soon to be replaced with Ptyxis), making it more functional.</p> <p>Gnome Note : </p> <p>I highly recommend against installing too many extensions if you want to keep your system stable.

Just launch toolkit from the dock, option <code>7</code> for service then <code>s</code> to reset. This will reset to out of box settings, so only do it after fresh install/update. If it happens after you changed things just re-apply theme/icon pack and you should be good to go.</p> <p>Q : Why not include nVidia GPU Drivers on the ISO ?</p> <p>A : Simply because we can only include one, limits device support, post-install covers a wider range of configs.</p> <p>Q : Why not add a Window Manager like Hyprland ?</p> <p>A : Because they can be too complex maintain, especially Hyprland which I think is moving way too fast for me to keep up with. Not to mention that I, as the sole maintainer have no plans on using it on the daily.</p> <p>Q : Why not include a well-known browser like Firefox or LibreWolf ?</p> <p>A : This was covered on a separate post ==&gt; Here</p> <p>Q : What if I cannot afford to donate, how can I get XeroLinux ?</p> <p>A : You can convert Vanilla Arch with either Gnome or KDE Plasma to mimic the distro ==&gt; Here</p> <p>Q : I dislike the way ArchInstall installs some DEs is there a better way to install them ?</p> <p>A : Yep, we have written a script that installs any of Gnome, KDE Plasma, XFCE, Hyprland or even Cosmic Alpha ==&gt; Here</p> <p>Q : Why doesn't the Distro include more tools for Gaming, Production and so on out the box ?</p> <p>A : Because while some of you might like our choices, others might not. That's why we prefer to leave the choice up to you. Plus it would keep the ISO size more manageable.</p> <p>Q : Can I request a feature or package to be added ?</p> <p>A : Of course you can ! But keep in mind that it will require us to weigh the pros &amp; cons of every feature or package before we agree to include them. It also depends on how useful they are. We reserve the right to accept or not. The decision is up to us. We want the Distro to remain stable and bloat free. The more we add the more variables we introduce that might break it for some. You can do so either Here or on Discord.</p> <p>Q : Why isn't the Distro free of charge like the majority out there ?</p> <p>A : We would love for it to be, but alas, it's currently the only way for it to survive the harsh reality we live in, especially that it's made in Lebanon, a war zone of sorts. Plus we need to pay for hosting, bandwidth, Internet and so on. But who knows what the future holds ? Maybe if things get better it will be free for everyone.</p> <p>Q : How can I/we contribute to the project ?</p> <p>A : Glad you asked that. Very easy, you can do that in may ways. You can either donate n grab the ISO to test and report bugs directly to us on Discord, or on Github. The more of you who do the better the distro will be.

All we need is a secondary PC running Linux. If none is available, this part can be skipped.</p> <p>Ok, first things first, we need to set a password to the root user. We do it by typing the following command in the TTY, like this :</p> <pre><code>passwd\n</code></pre> <p>Now we type our temporary password &amp; confirm it. Once that's done, we need to get the machine's IP Address, we do that by running this command :</p> <pre><code>ip a\n</code></pre> <p>Once we have it, all we need to do to connect to the machine is the following command :</p> <pre><code>ssh root@ipaddress\n</code></pre> <p>We confirm by typing <code>yes</code>. That's it, now we are connected to the machine remotely, so we can now easily copy paste comands for a much simpler install...</p> <ul> <li>ArchInstall Script</li> </ul> <p>Once connected, first thing we will have to do is, make sure we have latest version of ArchInstall. We do that by running the following command :</p> <pre><code>pacman -Syy archinstall &amp;&amp; archinstall --advanced\n</code></pre> <p>Now some of you might be asking me, \"why the <code>--advanced</code> flag ?\", to which I answer, simply because devs still hide the parallel downloads behind it for whatever reason. It's fine at least now you know.</p> <p>Ok, now that we have the installer running, am not going to go through each and every option one by one, just the important ones. Am also not gonna bother with manual partitioning since the guide is intended for single OS easy install.</p> <p>That's why we will be using the Best Guess option, carefully selecting the correct drive we want install ArchLinux onto.</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>User Data : I will not be held responsible for any data loss resulting from selection of the wrong drive. BE VERY CAREFUL HERE.</p> <p>Anyway, let's make sure we skip the parts like Profiles, Drivers, Extra Packages and Extra Repos, since everything will now be done Post-Install via my Toolkit. Don't forget to set parallel downloads to as many as you like for faster downloads. Also as mentioned, we do not need to enable any extra repos like multilib since my script will do that for us later on.</p> <p>Now once everything is configured and set, hit install, sit back, grab a cup of Tea/Coffee and watch it do its thing.

It also will install the XeroLinux Toolkit making it easier to configure your system post-install.</p> <p>I have written the script in such a way where it will check what distro it's being run on, blocking it from going any further if either a D.E is already installed, or if it's being run on anything other than a Base Arch Install. I did that to avoid any potential issues resulting in countless support tickes that would waste both your and my time. Better safe than sorry.</p> <p> </p> <p>Furthermore, I made sure that, during installation it would check if you are running it in a VM, if so it will install the relevant Guest Drivers/Utils. Not forgetting any of you who prefer to use a Bootloader other than Grub, where it will skip the part where it installs hooks and configs.</p> <p>Lastly, all D.E specific packages represent a meticulously curated list of how I would install them.
