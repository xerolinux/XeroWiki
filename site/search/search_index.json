However it pan out.

But keep in mind that it will require us to weigh the pros &amp; cons of every feature or package before we agree to include them. It also depends on how useful they are. We reserve the right to accept or not. The decision is up to us. We want the Distro to remain stable and bloat free. The more we add the more variables we introduce that might break it for some. You can do so either Here or on Discord.</p> <p>Q : How can I/we contribute to the project ?</p> <p>A : Glad you asked that. Very easy, you can do that in may ways. You can either donate n grab the ISO to test and report bugs directly to us on Discord, or on Github. The more of you who do the better the distro will be.
