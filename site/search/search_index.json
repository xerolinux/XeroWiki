The key differences between it and the KDE Flagship is that it's more oriented to those of you who do not game much, and prefer to have a stable system that stays out of your way while you do your work. It also hasn't been riced, eg no custom theme has been used, following the Gnome Guidelines. All I did was use the Accent color feature to enable the Purple colors, and for consistency, I applied the Tela Circle Purple icon theme, while including just enough extensions making it more functional.</p> <p>Gnome Note : </p> <p>I highly recommend against installing too many extensions if you want to keep your system stable.
