### Will there be desktop spins other than KDE Plasma?

No. Maintaining multiple desktop environments is not feasible as a solo project.

---

### Why is there a separate nVidia ISO?

nVidia retired driver support for legacy 900/1000 series cards. The dedicated nVidia ISO targets RTX-series cards with modern open drivers, while the Standard ISO serves Intel and AMD systems. See [**The Distro**](/distro/#iso-variants) for details.

---

### What about Hyprland or other window managers?

A Hyprland integration was attempted but discontinued. Archived code is available [**here**](https://github.com/xerolinux/HyprXero-git).

---

### Why isn't Firefox or LibreWolf included by default?

This was addressed in a dedicated post — [**read the explanation**](https://xerolinux.xyz/updates/browser-situation/).

---

### Why doesn't the ISO include more software out of the box?

To keep the distro lean and stable. More packages means more variables that can break things. The [**toolkit**](/xero-tool/) provides optional software categories so you install only what you need.

---

### Can I request a feature or package?

Yes, but all requests are evaluated for stability impact and usefulness. Submit requests on [**Fider**](https://fider.xerolinux.xyz) or [**Discord**](https://discord.xerolinux.xyz).

### How can I contribute?

- **Test and report bugs** — on [**Discord**](https://discord.xerolinux.xyz) or [**GitHub**](https://github.com/XeroLinuxDev/xero-build)
- **Donate** — grab the [**ISO**](/distro/) to support development
- **Submit content** — see the [**Contributions**](/contributions/) page
