### Information

This is a simple script, that will allow you to install any of the **Grub** themes I have created in the past. They will not be updated, that's just a relic of time past lol.

## Installation

I included a script that makes installing them much easier, just follow steps below :

1- Git Clone [**this**](https://github.com/xerolinux/xero-grubs){:target="_blank"} repo<br />
2- CD into it and run `sudo ./install.sh`<br />
3- Select one of the 8 themes, watch the magic.<br />
4- Reboot your system and see the theme in action !<br />

Be very careful playing with your bootloader. I made sure they work. Beyond that it's on you. This is provided as is with no warranty whatsoever...
