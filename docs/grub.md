### Information

This is a simple script, that will allow you to install any of the **Grub** themes I have created in the past. They will not be updated, that's just a relic of time past lol.

## Installation

I included a script that makes installing them much easier, just follow steps below :

1- Git Clone the repo & run script like so<br />

```Bash
git clone https://github.com/xerolinux/xero-grubs
cd xero-grubs/ && sudo ./install.sh
```

2- Select one of the 8 themes, watch the magic.<br />
3- Reboot your system and see the theme in action !<br />

Be very careful playing with your bootloader. I made sure they work. Beyond that it's on you. This is provided as is with no warranty whatsoever...
