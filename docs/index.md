# Welcome to the Xero Wiki

Welcome to **XeroLinux Wiki** ! Think of this page as your go-to hub for all things related to our scripts, tools, and configurations. Here, you'll find a comprehensive and centralized resource for every tweak, command, or customization option you've ever tinkered with.

!!! tip

    Announcements regarding my tools will be shared on the [**XeroLinux**](https://xerolinux.xyz){:target="_blank"} main site. Please make sure you are subscibed to its **RSS Feed** for any future updates.

It's meticulously designed to keep everything organized and accessible, so you can focus more on experimenting and less on searching for that one-liner you swear you wrote down somewhere.

This wiki is built with intuitive section links that seamlessly navigate to specific parts of the documentation. Imagine needing to remember a specific customization: simply enter the Customization page and press `i` in the toolkit, to instantly jump to the relevant section.

The goal is to make this your primary reference, eliminating the need to hunt through disparate notes or scattered files. As I phase out the current **GitHub wiki**, this will become the central repository for all my projects—better organized, more user-friendly, and directly integrated with the tools I use daily.

In order to cantact me, you can do so on either, [**Fosstodon**](https://fosstodon.org/@XeroLinux){:target="_blank"}, or [**Discord**](https://discord.gg/5sqxTSuKZu){:target="_blank"}
