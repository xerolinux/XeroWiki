A : We will be doing that, making it available through **Calamares** as on December 2025.

> Q : Why not add a Window Manager like **Hyprland** ?

A : We did try ! However it pan out. You can find archived code ==> [**Here**](https://github.com/xerolinux/HyprXero-git){:target="_blank"}

> Q : What if I cannot afford to donate, how can I get **XeroLinux** ?

A : Yep, there's a script that installs **Gnome**, **KDE Plasma**, **XFCE**, **Hyprland** or **Cosmic** ==> [**Here**](https://wiki.xerolinux.xyz/script/){:target="_blank"}

> Q : Why doesn't the Distro include more tools for Gaming, Production and so on out the box ?

A : While some of you might like our choices, others might not, leaving the choice up to you.

> Q : Can I request a feature or package to be added ?

A : Of course you can ! But keep in mind that it will require us to weigh the pros & cons of every feature or package before we agree to include them. It also depends on how useful they are. We reserve the right to accept or not. The decision is up to us. We want the Distro to remain stable and *bloat free*. The more we add the more variables we introduce that might break it for some. You can do so either [**Here**](https://fider.xerolinux.xyz){:target="_blank"} or on [**Discord**](https://discord.xerolinux.xyz){:target="_blank"}.

> Q : How can I/we contribute to the project ?

A : Glad you asked that. Very easy, you can do that in may ways. You can either donate n grab the ISO to test and report bugs directly to us on [**Discord**](https://discord.xerolinux.xyz){:target="_blank"}, or on [**Github**](https://github.com/XeroLinuxDev/xero-build){:target="_blank"}. The more of you who do the better the distro will be. Without you, bugs might remain unseen & unfixed.
