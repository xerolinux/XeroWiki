## FAQ & Answers

> Q : Theming broke after update how do I get it back ?

A : That happens from time to time due to system changes. Just launch toolkit from the dock, option `7` for service then `s` to reset. This will reset to out of box settings, so only do it after fresh install/update. If it happens after you changed things just re-apply theme/icon pack and you should be good to go.

> Q : Why not include **nVidia** GPU Drivers on the ISO ?

A : Simply because we can only include one, limits device support, post-install covers a wider range of configs.

> Q : Why not add a Window Manager like **Hyprland** ?

A : We did ! However not as an ISO but in post-install script form  ==> [**Here**](https://wiki.xerolinux.xyz/hyprxero/){:target="_blank"}

> Q : Why not include a well-known browser like **Firefox** or **LibreWolf** ?

A : This was covered on a separate post ==> [**Here**](https://xerolinux.xyz/updates/browser-situation/){:target="_blank"}

> Q : What if I cannot afford to donate, how can I get **XeroLinux** ?

A : You can convert Vanilla Arch with either **Gnome** or **KDE Plasma** to *mimic* the distro ==> [**Here**](https://xerolinux.xyz/posts/vanilla-to-xero/){:target="_blank"}

> Q : I dislike the way **ArchInstall** installs some DEs is there a better way to install them ?

A : Yep, we have written a script that installs any of **Gnome**, **KDE Plasma**, **XFCE**, **Hyprland** or even **Cosmic Alpha** ==> [**Here**](https://wiki.xerolinux.xyz/script/){:target="_blank"}

> Q : Why doesn't the Distro include more tools for Gaming, Production and so on out the box ?

A : Because while some of you might like our choices, others might not. That's why we prefer to leave the choice up to you. Plus it would keep the ISO size more manageable.

> Q : Can I request a feature or package to be added ?

A : Of course you can ! But keep in mind that it will require us to weigh the pros & cons of every feature or package before we agree to include them. It also depends on how useful they are. We reserve the right to accept or not. The decision is up to us. We want the Distro to remain stable and *bloat free*. The more we add the more variables we introduce that might break it for some. You can do so either [**Here**](https://fider.xerolinux.xyz){:target="_blank"} or on [**Discord**](https://discord.gg/5sqxTSuKZu){:target="_blank"}.

> Q : Why isn't the Distro free of charge like the majority out there ?

A : We would love for it to be, but alas, it's currently the only way for it to survive the harsh reality we live in, especially that it's made in **Lebanon**, a war zone of sorts. Plus we need to pay for hosting, bandwidth, Internet and so on. But who knows what the future holds ? Maybe if things get better it will be free for everyone.

> Q : How can I/we contribute to the project ?

A : Glad you asked that. Very easy, you can do that in may ways. You can either donate n grab the ISO to test and report bugs directly to us on [**Discord**](https://discord.gg/5sqxTSuKZu){:target="_blank"}, or on [**Github**](https://github.com/XeroLinuxDev/xero-build){:target="_blank"}. The more of you who do the better the distro will be. Without you, bugs might remain unseen & unfixed.
