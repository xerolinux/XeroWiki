!!! info

    I would like to clarify one very important aspect of ricing. We use custom themes, and those might not get updated very often, if at all by their respective developers/artists, which might result in some parts of the system and apps not to get themed correctly. That, my friends, is unfortunately out of our hands.

!!! warning

    Before you proceed, kindly note that Scripts will proceed to add both **XeroLinux** & **Chaotic-AUR** repos for less compilation. use this on a *Fresh Install* prior to making your own modifications. Also it's good to keep in mind that **ArchInstall** installs a minimal diabetic version selected DEs ;)

### Layan KDE Rice

This is my complete conversion script, that will transform your **KDE Plasma** into something out of this world. I spent days, nay weeks optimizing it for best performance and stability. Some bugs may remain, please report them.

**Installation :**

```Bash
git clone https://github.com/xerolinux/xero-layan-git
cd xero-layan-git/ && ./install.sh
```

### Dracula Cosmic Rice

This rice is work in progress, will always be. Note that I do not use **Cosmic** myself on the daily, so updates will be few and far between. Nevertheless, it's been thoroughly tested, and works as is, for now. I will say this once, this comes with minimal to no support, **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK !**. 

**Installation**

Quickest method :

```Bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://xerolinux.xyz/script/cosmic.sh)"
```

Or, if you prefer :
    
```Bash
wget https://xerolinux.xyz/script/cosmic.sh
chmod +x cosmic.sh && sh cosmic.sh
```

### KDE Tiling Special

This rice was created/contributed by [**MurderFromMars**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_jwY9Q683jumkBSaKne60A){:target="_blank"}, a member of the **XeroLinux** community Discord server. Kudos to him for putting in the hard work. 

**Installation :**

Unlike other rices, this will not include an automated install script. However, will embed a how-to video by the author, as well as written instructions, including a list of packages required to achieve this. Reason for that is simply because it's currently hard to do that. It's a complex setup. It's for those of you willing to tinker and learn.
