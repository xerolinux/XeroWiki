<h1 align="center">🎨 XeroLinux Contributions 🎨</h1>

!!! info

    Anything contributed here is by others, so if you ever encounter **ANY** issues, you report them to the authors not directly to me. Any reports I will recieve will go unanswered. Keep that in mind going forward.

## Overview

On this page I will be posting all user-contributed content after making sure all is good. Feel free to use **AT YOUR OWN RISK !**.

That being said, if you have anything to contribute to the project, you are more than welcome to do so. But before you do, just know that we will only accept ones that help make the Distro better no matter how. The only place you can do that though, is on the [**XeroLinux Community Discord**](https://discord.xerolinux.xyz){:target="_blank"}.

Kudos to him for putting in the hard work. For the Repo [**Click Here**](https://github.com/MurderFromMars/CyberXero-Theme-Repo){:target="_blank"}

**Installation :**

Unlike other rices, this will not include an automated install script. However, will embed a how-to video by the author, as well as written instructions, including a list of packages required to achieve this. Reason for that is simply because it's currently hard to do that. It's a complex setup. It's for those of you willing to tinker and learn.
