# <h2 align="center">üé® XeroLayan ‚Äî now on Hyprland üé®</h2>

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Info

**HyprXero** brings the stylish, polished feel of [**XeroLinux KDE**](https://github.com/xerolinux/xero-layan-git){:target="_blank"} to **Hyprland**, not as a full distro, but as a lightweight config you can drop into your setup. You get the same attention to design and user experience, paired with **Hyprland**‚Äôs smooth animations, low resource usage, and modern Wayland features. It‚Äôs a clean, fast, and good-looking way to enjoy the Xero vibe *without* needing a full ISO.

This config aims for simplicity and minimalism unlike many others out there that go overboard in my humble opinion. It's a good place to start with **Hyprland**. It's meant to be a *sane* base you can build on top of till your heart's content. You can either use it as is, or take it to another level, it's all up to you from here...

### ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî• Credits

This project was a real labor of love, built with the help of two **Legendary** people I‚Äôve come to respect: [**Array**](https://github.com/aellas){:target="_blank"} (Config) and [**DDubs**](https://github.com/dwilliam62){:target="_blank"} (Advisor). Their input and support were crucial at every step, and without their contributions, this wouldn‚Äôt have come together the way it did. I‚Äôm glad to have worked with them on this. I just created the install script üòá

### üìú Installation

!!! warning

    **Hyprland** can be complex in and by itself, for support please check their [**HyprWiki**](https://wiki.hyprland.org){:target="_blank"}. If you do not have any prior Linux knowledge, please do not use it or this config. We will not be held responsible in case you break your system. It's yours, you are responsible for everything that happens to it.
    
- **‚öôÔ∏è Supported Platforms :**

It is *Highly* recommended to only use this config on a fresh *Arch* install, meaning install base Arch using the ArchISO skipping profiles section entirely, once done, reboot and login to your newly created install/user in TTY then run the command below. In case you don't know how to do that, please follow the [**Installing ArchLinux**](https://wiki.xerolinux.xyz/script/#installing-archlinux){:target="_blank"} section of our previous guide. **Don't install on top of an existing DE/WM !**

- **üöÄ Installation :**

If you do not already have it please make sure you have `git` installed in order for this to work.

```Bash
git clone https://github.com/xerolinux/HyprXero-git
cd HyprXero-git/ && ./install.sh
```

The script will add the **XeroLinux** repository for the toolkit, then go ahead and install **Hyprland** and all required components. We did it that way so you can use it as a *Post-Install* script. It will also prompt you as to which **AUR-Helper** you want to use for packages coming from there. It will work with either `yay` or `paru` so doesn't matter which you choose.

Just a heads-up: it will **NOT** install any drivers or tools to get your hardware working-that part‚Äôs all on you. Think of it like a helpful sidekick that sets up your config and gets everything running smoothly, but it won‚Äôt handle the hardware magic. So, roll up your sleeves and get ready to tinker!

### ‚ùì FAQ

**‚öôÔ∏è Changing Default Applications**

You can easily customize the default applications Hyprland uses by editing the `~/.config/hypr/config/defaults.conf` file. Open this file in your preferred text editor and modify the lines corresponding to the application you want to change (e.g., `file_manager = thunar`, `terminal = kitty`, `browser = falkon`).

**‚öôÔ∏è Applying a different theme**

If you want to use a different theme instead of **Layan**, you certainly can, but it‚Äôs not as simple as on **KDE Plasma** or **Gnome**. For **QT** and **GTK** apps, you‚Äôll use **GTK Settings** or **Kvantum** included here. For things like **Waybar**, **Kitty**, or **SwayNC**, you‚Äôll need to manually edit their style files. We don‚Äôt use automatic tools like **Pywal** or **Matugen**, so expect to do some manual tweaking. It‚Äôs a bit more hands-on, but definitely doable if you enjoy customizing!

### üó®Ô∏è Wrap up

The install script will backup some app settings & all system ones before applying and overriding them with new ones, you will be able to restore what you need from the backup, so please do not report that. You have been warned. In case of any issues specific to this config please find us on our [**Discord**](https://discord.gg/5sqxTSuKZu){:target="_blank"}. Best of luck !
