# <h2 align="center">ðŸ’» Xero Install Scripts ðŸ’»</h2>

!!! note

    **Distro is Back** : If you want to skip all this, you can just *Donate* and grab the **XeroLinux KDE** pre-built ISO from ðŸ‘‰ [**Re-Release Post**](https://xerolinux.xyz/iso/){:target="_blank"}

### Scripts Prupse

The whole reason they were created was to fix the badly implemented **ArchInstall** profiles which do not provide a solid enough base, while extending them further nothing more. For customizations and other stuff, please use the included toolkit found in the app menu/launcher.

These scripts are subject to change over time, so please treat the video above as a general reference rather than an exact guide. As updates and improvements are made, some steps or options may differ from what is shown. Keep that in mind while following along, and always refer to the most recent version of this guide for the best results.

Finally, before we begin, none of these scripts will install a customized/riced version of the DEs keeping them *Vanilla*. It's all about the freedom of choice, leaving final setup up to you. I just included the tools you might need while taking care of all the dependencies, making it a little bit easier to setup your system.

### Installation Guide

#### System Preparation

Let's start off by knowing what we need to get started. First off, we will need the latest version of the >> [**ArchLinux ISO**](https://archlinux.org/download/){:target="_blank"}, a USB stick to burn ISO onto, we can either use >> [**Balena Etcher**](https://etcher.balena.io/#download-etcher){:target="_blank"} or the highly recommended >> [**Ventoy**](https://xerolinux.xyz/posts/ventoy-multi-boot/){:target="_blank"}.

Those are the essentials. Let's begin...

#### Installing ArchLinux

Ok, so now that we have burned the ISO to the USB using either tools, boot the system we want to install it on using it. Am not gonna go through showing you how, you should know that by now lol.

**Note :**

!!! warning

    This guide expects you to be connected to the internet via ethernet. If you aren't and need to connect over WiFi, you can follow guide on the [**ArchWiki**](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide#Connect_to_the_internet){:target="_blank"}

- **Remote Install via SSH**

Now, unlike other guides out there, I will be showing how we can use **SSH** to do the installation remotely, which will make things much easier. All we need is a secondary PC running **Linux**. If none is available, this part can be skipped.

Ok, first things first, we need to set a password to the *root* user. We do it by typing the following command in the TTY, like this :

```Bash
passwd
```

Now we type our temporary password & confirm it. Once that's done, we need to get the machine's **IP Address**, we do that by running this command :

```Bash
ip a
```

Once we have it, all we need to do to connect to the machine is the following command :

```Bash
ssh root@ipaddress
```

We confirm by typing `yes`. That's it, now we are connected to the machine remotely, so we can now easily copy paste comands for a much simpler install...

- **ArchInstall Script**

Once connected, first thing we will have to do is, make sure we have latest version of **ArchInstall**. We do that by running the following command :

```Bash
pacman -Syy archinstall && archinstall --advanced
```

Now some of you might be asking me, "why the `--advanced` flag ?", to which I answer, simply because devs still hide the *parallel downloads* behind it for whatever reason. It's fine at least now you know.

Ok, now that we have the installer running, am not going to go through each and every option one by one, just the important ones. Those are explained in the video. Am also not gonna bother with *manual partitioning* since the guide is intended for single OS easy install.

That's why we will be using the **Best Guess** option, carefully selecting the correct drive we want install **ArchLinux** onto.

!!! warning

    **User Data** : I will not be held responsible for any data loss resulting from selection of the wrong drive. **BE VERY CAREFUL HERE**.

Anyway, let's make sure we skip the parts I mentioned in the video, like *Profiles*, *Drivers*, *Extra Packages* and *Extra Repos*, since everything will now be done **Post-Install** via my Toolkit. Don't forget to set parallel downloads to as many as you like for faster downloads. Also as mentioned, we do not need to enable any extra repos like *multilib* since my script will do that for us later on.

Now once everything is configured and set, hit install, sit back, grab a cup of Tea/Coffee and watch it do its thing. Might take a while it all depends on Internet connection...

#### The scripts

!!! tip

    **Inspection**. We do not recommend to blindly execute scripts without inspecting them first. Check out the code >> [**Multi-DE**](https://github.com/xerolinux/XeroHub/blob/main/content/script/xero-install.sh){:target="_blank"}, or [**Cosmic-Alpha**](https://github.com/xerolinux/XeroHub/blob/main/content/script/xero-cosmic.sh){:target="_blank"}.

We have combined previous ones into a single *Multi-DE* installer since they were all similar. Easier for everyone. Thanks to [**SpiderPunkXL**](https://github.com/SpiderPunkXL){:target="_blank"} for the idea. We just kept the **Cosmic** one separate simply because it's still in *Alpha* stages and shouldn't be combined with stable ones. Still needs time to bake as the saying goes.

Anyway, once that's all done, we will be prompted if we want to `chroot` into our new install, we answer with yes of course since we still have no DE yet.

Once you trust it, you can move on. Now, depending on the method that was used, `ssh` or not, we either copy paste one of the commands below or type it manually :

!!! warning

    The scripts shared herein are work-in-progress, especially the **Cosmic** which is still in Alpha stages. Please do not use it on your production machine. Either use in a VM (bad idea) or on a test machine, like a side laptop or something.

- Cosmic Alpha :

```Bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://xerolinux.xyz/script/xero-cosmic.sh)"
```

- Plasma/Gnome & XFCE

```Bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://xerolinux.xyz/script/xero-install.sh)"
```

The scripts will perform several checks and then prompt you to confirm the addition of the **XeroLinux** and **Chaotic-AUR** repositories, along with my recommended configurations. If you agree, simply follow the prompts. The script will exit if you choose not to proceed.

#### The exec Blockers

I have also implemented some checks making sure script is being run in *chroot* and on *ArchLinux* blocking execution anywhere else. This helps me in the long run not having to bang my head against the wall trying to provide support in case it was run on Distros I have no control over.

</p>

So to avoid the headaches, I decided to block the execution. Better for everyone. This will allow me to concentrate on the distro and other current/future projects, with support being limited within **XeroLinux**.

</p>

While I've meticulously reviewed all packages and groups to ensure the best experience via my **Curated list**, you are free to choose any of the other options. You will also notice that the *multilib* repo was enabled. I made sure of that since most newcomers forget to do it. It's an essential repo required for the likes of **Steam**, and various drivers.

Now, installation might take a while, it all depends on the speed of your Internet connection. I have included quite a few quality-of-life packages which should make your experience as Seamless as possible.

Finally, for now at least, once script is done, we will be prompted to exit and reboot the system. We do that by typing `exit` then `reboot`, and that's it for this part anyway...

#### System Configuration

If all went smoothly, we should now be greeted with the login page. Once logged in, open Terminal, and update the system. Done !

```Bash
sudo pacman -Syyu
```

Then we launch the **XeroLinux Post Installation Toolkit** from the App Launcher. That's it.

It's up to you to discover all the options. The whole point of this guide is how to get included DEs installed the right way while expanding them a little, not to set up the system from A to Z. For more info, check out the [**Toolkit Wiki**](https://wiki.xerolinux.xyz/xlapit/)
