# <h2 align="center">üêß Xero Post-Install Toolkit üêß</h2>

!!! warning

    It's crucial to clarify that this toolkit isn't intended for custom Arch-Based distros. While some elements might function, I can't ensure seamless compatibility due to potential conflicts arising from differing tweaks and repositories. To ensure optimal performance.

### What it is

This toolkit aims to be an all-in-one solution for post-installation, expediting your Arch setup. It's offered as use at your own risk type of thing, without much support. You will have to rely on yourself and your own knowledge and ability to do research your setup.

![type:video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/bEFBO2QRN8E)

Toolkit recieves a lot of updates on almost a daily basis. Use above video just as a reference not an absolute lol. I keep getting ideas which I immediately implement. Due to the amount of changes I cannot keep a changelog, sorry. Too many to keep up with. **Feel free to fork it, modify what you need to make it work better for you, it's FOSS !**

### How to get it

First off let me say that everything this awesome toolkit provides is and will forever be optional and up to you the user. I will never force anything on you.

!!! tip

    Don't just run script, without inspecting it first. So before using _Curl_ command below you can examine it => [**HERE**](https://github.com/xerolinux/xlapit-cli/tree/main/xero-scripts/scripts){:target="_blank"}. It will always be provided as is without any **Warranty** of any kind. If you need support you know where to find me. Hint : "check the footer for links".

Now, once you have inspected the code, just run this simple curl command to get started :

```Bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://xerolinux.xyz/script/xapi.sh)"
```

It will prompt you before injecting as in adding the XeroLinux repository, where from it will then prompt you, should you agree, as to which AUR helper you prefer, then proceed to do so then install and launch the toolkit.. Again only if you agree..

### Acessing Toolkit

You can access toolkit by either typing `xero-cli -m` in terminal or from the application menu via the **XeroLinux Post Installation Toolkit** shortcut.. Just close terminal window once done using it lol ;)

Although some DEs like [**Gnome**](https://apps.gnome.org/Software/){:target="_blank"} and [**KDE Plasma**](https://apps.kde.org/discover/){:target="_blank"} come with their own GUI package manager, they have some limitations. That's why I decided to include others that give us more freedom. See below...

**- Game Launchers**

!!! tip

### Recommended Packages

!!! warning

    The **System Tools** option will just go ahead and install everything in it. I only selected the important stuff nothing big or unnecessary from both Arch Repos and the AUR, so might take abit to install everything depending on your specs. For transparency I included the list below the table so you know what's gonna be installed on your system should you opt to install.

**- Various Extra Pkgs**

### GPU Driver Notes

When it comes to **GPU Drivers**, toolkit covers most common setups. It should cover most cases, but there's no one solution for all, especially for **Hybrid** setups, so if you have any issues let me know...

### How to Contribute

If you can/want to Contribute your knowledge improving this toolkit taking it above and beyond, making it the defacto for every **Arch** user, please see [**Here**](https://github.com/xerolinux/xlapit-cli/wiki/User-Contribution){:target="_blank"} for more information.

### Toolkit Credits

Main menu is written in **Rust** thanks to [**OgloTheNerd**](https://github.com/Oglo12){:target="_blank"}. And some contributions were made by a friend of the project [**It-A-Me**](https://github.com/it-a-me){:target="_blank"}. Thanks to them this Toolkit wouldn't have reached this point.
