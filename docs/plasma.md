<h2 align="center">.//ðŸ’» The Plasma-Install Script ðŸ’»\\.</h2>

!!! note

    This does not require a Wiki page, it's here for reference as it has a full in-depth guide with a video included, on our [**Official Site**](https://xerolinux.xyz/news/xerolinux-plasma/){:target="_blank"} where we go over each step in detail. Follow it closely for best experience. I might port back to here in the future.

### What it is

With the help of this script, you will be able to install **Plasma** in one of 4 methods as you can see in the image below. Not only that, but it will also fix **PipeWire** and **Bluetooth**.

This script has an option to include my repo, **Chaotic-AUR**'s & Toolkit. Toolkit also includes the option to apply my rice. So if you opt to include it, you do not need to get other projects/tools separately. Itâ€™s meant as an All-in-One solution.
